## Name

This website is for my CMPT 120 Semester Project. If all goes well, this will showcase my understanding of Python, HTML, Flask, and various other aspects of programming.

## Description

The final iteration of the website should:

1. Demonstrate knowledge of python programming and the ability to host web pages.
2. Use Flask to manage a web server
3. Show good folder management, keep things tidy
4. Show the ability to manage multiple webpages and host static content on the web using basic HTML and a Flask Web server
5. Have the ability to access all of your views from other pages
6. Design and create views to fluidly move from one page to another
7. Demonstrate knowledge and implement proper style using comments and PEP8 compliant code. Some leniency will be granted here but things should be neat and tidy
8. Design a site to represent yourself or a dummy topic or person if you don't want to make one for yourself
9. You should have 4+ pages with content on the following. Feel free to lorem ipsum content if you'd like. I'll be looking for variability in these pages. I suggest using something like Boostrap, Materialize, or Foundation so that you can pick and choose HTML elements from the content that each of the frameworks provides
10. Be able to handle if a user travels to a page you don't have throwing a 404 error
11. Add logging that announces when a user is switching pages
12. Create a README for your repo that instructs how to start up your webpage.

## How to Start the Webpage

Starting the webpage needs to be done through Flask. Once you select what folder the Flask app file is located, you need to type "export FLASK_APP=hello.py" followed by "flask run" to then get the link to open the website. Without doing this to get the link, the user will not be able to open the website.
