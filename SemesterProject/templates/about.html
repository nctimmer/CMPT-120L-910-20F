<h3>About Noah</h3>

<p>Hi, I'm Noah, and I'm a Sophomore at Marist College.</p>
<p>Usually, most of my time is absorbed by schoolwork because I took 17 credits in the fall. If I'm not doing school I'm probably doing one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Video Creation</li></ul>
<ul><li>Full-Time Job</li></ul>
<ul><li>Running/Working Out</li></ul>
